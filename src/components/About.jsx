         Iâ€™m a 3rd-year Information Technology student and a passionate Frontend Developer who loves blending design and functionality to create beautiful, user-friendly web experiences. My journey into tech began with a simple curiosity about how websites work, and itâ€™s grown into a full-blown passion for turning ideas into interactive reality.  
Currently, Iâ€™m exploring the MERN stack to expand my skills into full-stack development. I thrive on solving tricky bugs, experimenting with new frameworks, and building projects that people genuinely enjoy using.  
Outside of coding, youâ€™ll probably find me sketching UI ideas, exploring new tech trends, or sipping coffee while brainstorming my next project.
